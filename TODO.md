- Font: I'd like to use: Darker Grothesque
        - Light for Titles
        - Regular for Long Texts


- Font Color: Please make it two shades darker and make it warmer  in tone (right now the grey is a bit towards the blue shade)

- Copyright  and contact are going too down in the page. Should be clearly visible at the bottom as the page opens (so I think it needs to be shifted up a bit)

- The footer should include Gallery Representation as photoink.net (link) (perhaps on the right bottom corner)d

- The forward and backward arrows in each story has to be constantly place at a specific distance from the beginning and end of the images.

- The text in each story should be as wide as the photograph. If the text is long and extends down, that is fine.

- When you come to the last photo in each story, the last photo should not freeze. It should move 'quarter way and then back 'to indicate the end of the story. (refer to Gideon’s website)

- In all the stories I will add or remove photographs

- In the main Headers, put 'Kashmir' first followed by 'Laxmi'

- Title: ANITA KHEMKA to be one point bigger and leave a little more space from the top edge of the page.
     The main header will have the following headers: Laxmi, Kashmir, Self Portraits, My Name is Anita, Munna Guru and Ramkali, Commissioned Work and Abou

- Commissioned work will have sub-headers as Author Portraits, HIV, Maternal Health. I will add more sections here with time as I edit more of my interesting stories (but not now)

- In the 'About' Section add sub headers Biography, Curriculum Vitae and Contact. I will sent the content of both Biography and CV.

- In the 'Contact' section write:
    - Anita Khemka (Bold)
    - contact@anitakhemka.com
    - Gallery PHOTOINK (Bold)
    - info@photoink.net

 

- Under Laxmi section:
    - Spelling of Laxmi to be corrected as Laxmi.
    - The sub-headers in Laxmi should be named only as years and not prefixed with laxmi.
    - The images should be a size bigger. We want to see how this looks so just increase the size in1 image.
    - One Image is small in the series. I will resend this image.

 

 - Self Portraits

    - In the self portraits increase the size of the images be one size.
    - In the text of Self Portraits remove the first line, ’Anita Khemka (b.1972)’

- Being Anita
    - Change the Title to “My Name is Anita”
    - Increase the size of the photographs. We want to see how this looks so just increase the size in1 image.Anita Khemka
